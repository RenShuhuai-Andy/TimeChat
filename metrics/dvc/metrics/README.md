# captioning-metrics

This is a fork from https://github.com/salaniz/pycocoevalcap, with several functionalities that make it easier to run for dense video captioning, e.g. not closing the METEOR jar at every call but only once per evaluation.

To use it, you may download https://github.com/salaniz/pycocoevalcap/tree/master/meteor/data and put in under the data/ folder.
